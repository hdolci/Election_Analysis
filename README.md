# Election Analysis

Using mock data of a local election in Colorado, I will use Python to determine the following information:

* Calculate the total number of votes casted
* Generate a complete list of candidates that received votes
* Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
* Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate received
* Determine the winner of the election

## Resources
